# Multi-Agent Workflow for Resume Processing
### Objective

Develop a multi-agent workflow that performs the following tasks:

- Resume Reading: Read and process multi-page resumes in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).

- Entity Extraction: Extract key entities from the resumes, such as personal information, education, work experience, skills, and other pertinent details.

- Entity Validation: Validate the extracted entities for accuracy and completeness. If any issues are detected, the system should flag them and initiate a correction process.

### Features
- UI: Streamlit
- Framework: Langgraph, Langchain
- Model: OpenAI (integrated within Langchain)
- File Loaders: PyMuPDFLoader and Docx2txtLoader

### How does it work?
1. The file uploaded is identified by its type and the contents are extracted.

2. File Loading and Parsing
    - Uses PyMuPDFLoader and Docx2txtLoader to read files.
    - Retrieve the content from uploaded files for further processing.

3. Agents:
   - reader : receives the content and makes small changes or beautifies it
   - extractor : extracts the relevant fields from the content
   - validator : reviews the correctness of the extraction

4. A Graph is created using Langgraph with these agents as the nodes and connecting them using edges with termination conditions

5. A router logic is defined as to when to terminate the graph

6. Each agent's output is printed with the final extraction
